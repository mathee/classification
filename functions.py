""" needs functions for:
    EXPLORATION
    + correlation matrix
    + combined columns (--> function should already be available somewhere) / interaction terms
    
    + show mean classes for specific grouped categories
    
    FEATURE ENGINEERING
    + one hot encoding: creating columns for each code, automatic naming
    + scaling 
    + further binning? a function that creates bins depending on another function, mapping, ranges etc
        or detecting columns where number of unique values not higher than XX % of total number of rows, bin those
    + filling empty rows, gaps etc
    + slicing between first and last valid row?
    + everything else should be done individually maybe...
